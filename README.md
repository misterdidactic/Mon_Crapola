# WHAT UP AND WELCOME TO MY HOT MESS OF A REPO

Here I will dump unto you my scripts, applets, services, junk, bunk, and detritus what I went and made to automate stuff I refuse to do by hand anymore.

### Monotoggler (MacOS)

My P.A. system doesn't do stereo so I miss half of the auditory experience when I'm blasting my fat beats, ya dig? This little buddy automates toggling the accessibility settings to mono audio output. Here is a [link](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/8299/how-do-i-make-an-applescript-file-into-a-mac-app) detailing how to create an app out of it for easy launching with spotlight or from your dock.

### sevastolink.sh

I have this in my bash profile on almost every machine I use so that my terminals start up with this little cutie. For copyright reasons you'll have to find your own .sevastopol.mp3. To run it just type sev and hit enter. I add "sev" to the end of my bash profile in order to run it every time I open a new terminal.

### random_IP_addr.py

I made this for learning to count in binary. It will prompt you with a random IP address in decimal and when you're ready, you can hit any key and it will show you the address in binary for you to compare with your own.

### tptbf.py

A simple python script for macOS based on Merlin Mann's (10+2)*5 post on 43folders. Merlin Mann's original post can be found here. Run the script from a bash prompt using python tptbf.py and optionally add the option for how many hours, i.e. python tptbf.py 3 to try to get s\*\*t done for three hours
